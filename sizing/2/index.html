<!-- 
    This task has a box, which contains another box. Your task is to make the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box. The value of the box-sizing property is set to border-box, which means that the total width includes any padding and border. You should also give the inner box padding of 10% using the width (or inline size) as the size from which that percentage is calculated.
